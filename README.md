I started doing the Odin Project on July 15th and this etch a sketch project was in the foundations portion of the program.

While working full time and also working a second part time job
I started teaching myself Python in late april early May some time and I was impressed at what I could do not putting my full time towards it and how much I had learned about Python and the tech space in general.

I did watch Youtube videos and had one physical book along the way and coming from Python to JavaScript made me rethink what I was capable of. Python was not an "easy" thing I picked up right away, I struggled for a while on loops and exactly what it meant for something to be an object. Although, I am now able to write fun small programs in Python I thought a lot of what I knew could be transferrable.

Which, some of it is but not all. First of all the syntax is so differnt I feel as if Python is a bit more straight forward more similar to natural language whereas JS is not; so that is where I had a bit of a hard time understanding.

I have also not manipulated files with Python before so using JS to manipulate the dom as well was something that was difficult for me to grasp.

I am starting to understand more the more I review and watch videos and ask questions so I am proud I was able to complete this project with more understanding. 

I did have to go to youtube to visually see / get things explained to me in a different way and that helped a lot. 

For the remainder of my time working with the Odin Project I will be using Youtube (like how I did for Python) as I feel I learn best by visually seeing others doing something then doing it myself as well. I think it is a great help to take what I am reading about that may not make sense and see it being explained again, just in video form.
